                <p class="one">One of the earliest fruits to be grown, the mango is said to have originated around 4,000 years ago in the region that is now Bangladesh, Myanmar, and India. It is deeply ingrained in South Asian religion and culture, and Hindu texts mention it. It is revered and frequently utilised in religious rites. India's Mughal monarchs, especially Akbar, were renowned for having vast mango groves. Throughout the 10th and 16th centuries, Portuguese explorers and Persian and Arab traders brought mangoes to the Middle East, Africa, Brazil, the Caribbean, and other tropical areas. This marked the beginning of the worldwide mango boom.</p>
                <p class="two">Mangoes are now a major agricultural product grown around the world in tropical and subtropical climates; important producers include Mexico, the Philippines, China, Thailand, Indonesia, India, and the Philippines. There are hundreds of types, and each has a unique texture and flavour. Mangoes are prized not just for their mouthwatering flavour but also for their high antioxidant, fibre, and vitamin A and C content. Their path from ancient South Asia to becoming a popular fruit around the world demonstrates their lasting popularity and significance to the global economy.</p>
                <p class="three">Mangoes have great cultural and historical value, but they are also quite versatile in the kitchen and have a significant economic influence. In nations that produce mangoes, millions of farmers and labourers rely on mangoes for their livelihood, which also greatly boosts local economies. The variety of foods and goods they have influenced—from fresh fruit and juices to chutneys, salads, and desserts—shows how well-liked they are. Every type, such the Ataulfo from Mexico and the Alphonso from India, has a distinct flavour that appeals to a wide range of palates. Mangos are widely recognised as a symbol of hospitality and friendliness throughout all cultures. Their journey from ancient orchards to modern kitchens highlights their eternal significance and worldwide appeal.</p>
